                         <p><b>Islam Makhachev</b> is the lightweight champion with a professional record of 26-1. He is described as one of the best well-rounded fighters, as he has demonstrated his progression not only in his grappling but in his striking.</p>
                                    <img src="images/Jon.jpg" alt="Heavyweight Champion" height="200px">
                                <p><b>Jon(Bone)Jones</b> has been an undefeated fighter since 2008 arguably one of the best fighters in the world. His only loss was due to a disqualification, however, due to his inactivity his fans believe that he must prove himself against the interim champion <b>Tom Aspinall.</b></p>

                                <p><b>Alex(Poatan)Pereira</b> joined the UFC in 2021 and has been a rising star ever since. Having only lost one time in the UFC against his rival Israel Adesanya in April 2023, he has proven himself being an unstoppable force with his left hook. Chama!</p>

                                <p><b>Ilia(El matador)Topuria</b> has also been a force to be reckoned with as he has knocked out the unkockable such as Max Holloway and Volkanovski with his swift and precide boxing.</p>
                                    <img src="images/Belal.jpg" alt="Welterweight Champion" height="200px">
                                <p><b>Belal(Remember the name)Muhammad</b> is currently the welterweight champion when he beat former champion Leon Edwards in July 2024. Belal Mahammad has faced some criticism for always winning a fight by decision and never by knock out or submission.</p>
